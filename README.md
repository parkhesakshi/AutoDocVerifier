Automated Document Verification System
Overview
This project is an automated document verification system designed to enhance the efficiency and accuracy of verifying documents. The system leverages digital signatures and OCR (Optical Character Recognition) technology to extract and validate data from uploaded documents. It provides real-time verification status updates to users.

Features
Digital Signatures: Ensures the authenticity and integrity of documents.
OCR Technology: Extracts data from uploaded documents for further processing.
Dynamic UI: User-friendly interface designed using React.js.
Business Logic Implementation: Handles the core functionality of the system.
API Integration: Seamless integration with third-party services and internal APIs.
User Authentication: Secure login and registration system.
Document Management: Efficiently manages document uploads, storage, and retrieval.
Real-time Verification: Provides instant status updates on document verification.
Technologies Used
Frontend: React.js
Backend: Node.js, Express.js
OCR: Tesseract.js or any suitable OCR library
Database: MongoDB (or any other preferred database)
Authentication: JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for secure user authentication
Installation
Prerequisites
Node.js and npm installed on your machine.
MongoDB installed and running.
